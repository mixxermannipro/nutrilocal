# Contributing to Fud AI

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Fud AI is an open-source, "bring-your-own-key" calorie tracker. The repo is a monorepo:

- `ios/` — SwiftUI iOS app (current release candidate: v6.0 build 33)
- `android/` — Kotlin + Jetpack Compose app (current release candidate: v6.0 / versionCode 33)
- `web/` — marketing site at [fud-ai.app](https://fud-ai.app) (plain HTML/CSS, Cloudflare Workers Static Assets)

PRs, bug reports, and feature ideas for any of these are welcome.

## Getting Started (iOS)

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Open `ios/calorietracker.xcodeproj` in Xcode (16+)
4. Build and run on a simulator or device running iOS 17.6 or later

For normal feature work, just Xcode and a valid Apple developer account are enough.

## Getting Started (Android)

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Open `android/` in Android Studio (Narwhal or newer), let Gradle sync
4. Hit ▶ Run on a connected device or emulator (Android 8.0 / API 26+)

CLI alternative:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"
cd android
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb shell am start -n com.apoorvdarshan.calorietracker/.MainActivity
```

Android Studio is needed for the SDK + bundled JDK, but you can do all your day-to-day editing/building/installing from the terminal once it's installed.

## Getting Started (Web)

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. `cd web && python3 -m http.server 8000` (any static server works)
4. Open http://localhost:8000

The site is plain HTML/CSS with a validation-only npm build step and no framework. It is deployed with Cloudflare Workers Static Assets from `web/` using `web/wrangler.toml`.

Marketing screenshots live in `web/assets/screenshots/` and are also used by the README. When replacing screenshots, update the whole set together so the website and README stay in sync.

## First-Run Setup (both platforms)

Go to **Settings → AI Access** in the running app. In BYOK mode, paste an API key for any of the 13 supported providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, Grok, Groq, OpenRouter, Together AI, Hugging Face, Fireworks AI, DeepInfra, Mistral, Ollama for local, or any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint). A free Gemini key from [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) is the fastest way to get started. Keys are stored in iOS Keychain (iOS) or EncryptedSharedPreferences/AES-256 (Android). Food-description analysis for text, voice-transcribed, and Siri food logs can use Apple Intelligence on-device only as the final fallback after BYOK provider/fallback attempts fail on supported iPhones. (The optional Fud AI Premium proxy from earlier versions has been discontinued — the app is BYOK-only.)

Barcode logging on iOS and Android uses Open Food Facts directly from the device and does not require an API key. If a packaged food is missing or incomplete there, the app should report that clearly and let the user photograph the packaging through Camera or Photos instead of inventing values. Camera and Photos both support up to 10 separate images with an optional note; keep that shared capture-review-analysis path and the same retry/edit flow on both platforms.

For a codebase overview, start with the Architecture and Source Layout sections in [`README.md`](README.md), then follow the platform-specific patterns already used beside the code you are changing.

## Code Style (iOS)

- **SwiftUI** with `@Observable` (not `ObservableObject`)
- Environment injection via `.environment()` (not `.environmentObject()`)
- Main actor isolation is default (`SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor`) — no manual `@MainActor` annotations needed
- Services are stateless structs with static methods (`GeminiService`, `ChatService`, `SpeechService`, etc.)
- Xcode auto-discovers files via `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup` — **do not** edit `project.pbxproj` to register source files
- Every user-facing string must be added to `ios/calorietracker/Localizable.xcstrings`; English is required, and touched translations should be updated wherever practical
- All data persistence is local (`UserDefaults` + iOS Keychain). No Core Data, no iCloud, no CloudKit
- Siri/App Intents live under `ios/calorietracker/AppIntents/`; phrase-help UI is opened from + → Describe Meal → Siri Phrases on iOS

## Code Style (Android)

- **Jetpack Compose** with manual DI via `FudAIApp.container` (`AppContainer`) — no Hilt
- Each screen has a `*ViewModel` exposing `StateFlow<UiState>`; UI collects via `collectAsState()`
- Repositories expose `Flow<T>` from DataStore; ViewModels `combine()` them into screen state
- Every user-facing string lives in `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`; English is required, and touched translations should be updated in the 14 non-English locale files (`values-{ar,az,de,es,fr,hi,it,ja,ko,nl,pt-rBR,ro,ru,zh-rCN}/strings.xml`) wherever practical
- Model enums (`Gender`, `MealType`, `AIProvider`, etc.) expose `@get:StringRes val displayNameRes: Int` — no hardcoded `displayName: String` strings
- All data persistence is local (DataStore Preferences + EncryptedSharedPreferences). No Room, no Firebase, no cloud
- When touching the release build path: keep R8 keep rules in `app/proguard-rules.pro` for kotlinx.serialization, Glance, WorkManager+Room, Health Connect — these all crash production-only without explicit keeps

## Pull Requests

1. Create a branch from `main`
2. Keep changes focused — one feature or fix per PR
3. Test on a real device if possible (the Release config is intentional — it matches what users see)
4. Run the Codex review before opening the PR if you have it set up: `codex exec review --commit <SHA> --full-auto`
5. Address P1 and P2 findings. P3 is judgment-call
6. Write a clear PR description explaining the **why**, not just the **what**

## Reporting Issues

## Adding an AI Provider

The app already supports 13 providers across 3 API dialects. Add it to **both clients** to keep parity:

**iOS:**
1. Add a case to `AIProvider` in `ios/calorietracker/Models/AIProvider.swift`
2. Set `baseURL`, `models`, `apiFormat`, `apiKeyPlaceholder`
3. **If `apiFormat == .openaiCompatible`** → done; `GeminiService` + `ChatService` route automatically
4. **Custom shape** → add a branch in both `GeminiService.callAI` and `ChatService.sendMessage`; keep the 1s/2s/4s exponential-backoff loop for 503/529/429

**Android:** mirror the same enum case in `android/.../models/AIProvider.kt` with matching `baseUrl`/`models`/`apiFormat`. Custom shapes need a new client in `services/ai/` and a branch in both `FoodAnalysisService` + `ChatService`. `RetryPolicy` already handles backoff — just route through it.

Include vision-capable model IDs since the app needs vision for food photo analysis.

## Adding a Speech-to-Text Provider

**iOS:** extend `SpeechProvider` in `ios/calorietracker/Models/SpeechProvider.swift` and add the handler in `SpeechService.transcribe`. **Android:** extend `models/SpeechProvider.kt` and add a client in `services/speech/`. Follow the pattern from the existing providers (OpenAI, Groq, Deepgram, AssemblyAI).

## Localization

iOS ships 16 locale resources; Android ships 15. English is the complete fallback on both platforms, so a missing translation must never block rendering or produce an empty label. Update every affected locale when practical and call out intentional fallback copy in the PR.

**iOS:** Add to `ios/calorietracker/Localizable.xcstrings` (String Catalog) — Xcode auto-extracts new English strings on build with `SWIFT_EMIT_LOC_STRINGS = YES`, but leaves the other 15 columns empty. Fill the translations you are changing and verify fallback behavior for the rest.

**Android:** Add the key to `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`, then update the relevant non-English `values-*/strings.xml` files. Android intentionally falls back to the default English resource while locale updates are completed; release lint disables only `MissingTranslation` for that reason. Enums use `displayNameRes: Int` instead of `displayName: String` — see the existing `MealType` / `WeightGoal` for the pattern.

Before committing, build both platform resources so malformed translations and format-argument mismatches fail locally, then spot-check any locale files you touched.
