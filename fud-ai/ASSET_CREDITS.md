# Asset Credits

Exercise data, names, instructions, and images in the Workouts tab come from the [Free Exercise DB](https://github.com/yuhonas/free-exercise-db) and are bundled locally under `ios/calorietracker/Resources/FreeExerciseDB/` (see its `LICENSE.md` and `README.md`). The Android app merges the same `exercises.json` and exercise images from the iOS resources at build time.

Barcode product lookups are powered by the [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org) database, queried live via its public API. Open Food Facts data is available under the [Open Database License (ODbL)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/); the database is made by a community of contributors. Fud AI does not bundle the database — nutrition facts are fetched per scanned barcode.

App icon artwork was provided by the project owner and bundled locally in the asset catalogs.

The pixel-art tip icons in the iOS Tip Jar (Settings → Leave a Tip) were generated with [PixelLab](https://www.pixellab.ai) and are bundled in the iOS asset catalog.

Muscle glyph assets (the muscle-filter icons in the Workouts tab) are cropped/rasterized derivatives of SVG muscle paths from [`react-muscle-highlighter`](https://github.com/soroojshehryar/react-muscle-highlighter) 1.2.0, MIT License. The generated app assets are bundled locally (iOS asset catalog, Android `app/src/main/assets/muscle/`) and do not depend on the upstream repository at runtime.
